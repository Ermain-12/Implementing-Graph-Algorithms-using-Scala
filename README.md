# Implementing Graph Algorithms Using Scala [Video]
This is the code repository for [Implementing Graph Algorithms Using Scala [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/implementing-graph-algorithms-using-scala-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788472364), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Explore several scala features while implementing many of the graph algorithms and techniques. These include matrix and adjacency list representations, BFS and DFS traversal, cycle detection, topological sorts, shortest path and finding the maximum flow in a flow network.
